% Newton's Method Template for Nonlinear Programming Problems in MATLAB

function [optimal_solution, optimal_value] = NewtonMethod(f, grad_f, hess_f, x0, tol, max_iter)
    % Input: f is the objective function, grad_f is the gradient of f, hess_f is the Hessian of f
    %        x0 is the initial point, tol is the tolerance, max_iter is the maximum number of iterations
    % Output: optimal_solution is the optimal solution, optimal_value is the optimal objective value

    % Initialize the algorithm
    x = x0;
    iter = 0;

    % Main loop
    while iter < max_iter
        % Compute the gradient and Hessian at the current point
        g = grad_f(x);
        H = hess_f(x);

        % Check for convergence
        if norm(g) < tol
            break;
        end

        % Update the solution using Newton's method
        x = x - H \ g;

        % Increment the iteration counter
        iter = iter + 1;
    end

    % Return the optimal solution and value
    optimal_solution = x;
    optimal_value = f(x);
